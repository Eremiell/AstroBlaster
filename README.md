The game is made as an example project for C++ Game Development course I teach.

You will need separate [resources archive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4Hzo4KUF1VvTklVdUR4Q1A5TUE/view?usp=sharing).

The game uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and [TinyXML2](http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2/) libraries. (Some more may be added as we go.)

See more info in [Design Document](doc/design_document.md).
